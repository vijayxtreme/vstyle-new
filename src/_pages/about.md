## The History of Me

I started off my career with a B.A. in Business Economics student from U.C. Riverside. I worked from 2005 to 2009 in marketing as a project manager for The Press-Enterprise.

I switched to Web Development around 2011 after I rediscovered I liked making websites, a hobby of mine from my high school and college days.  At UCR, I was the web developer for the organization, [Asian Pacific Student Programs](https://apsp.ucr.edu/). I learned PHP, and began making sites in Wordpress.  I worked contract until 2013, when I joined [Neoganda](http://www.neoganda.com/) agency in Hollywood and then began working on their project, [Addroid](https://addroid.com/) full time writing in JavaScript and PHP.  After Addroid, I moved to contract again, then worked for [Budget Van Lines](https://www.budgetvanlines.com/) from 2014-2016 full time helping develop landing pages for moving companies using PHP, JQuery and Zend Framework.

In late 2016, I joined [RadNet](https://radnet.com) Medical Imaging.  I worked as a Software Engineer for the West Coast Marketing team and developed primarily in PHP and Drupal.  I worked at RadNet for 4 years and led the efforts to redesign and develop a modern look and feel for the sites using the React Ecosystem along with AWS Cloud.  This resulted in huge cost savings for the company as well as a competitive new look for their products.

I joined Beachbody in 2020, and worked primarily on [BeachbodyonDemand](https://beachbodyondemand.com), a paid member site to access workouts, recipes and tracking information for customers.  I worked as a Full Stack Sr Software Engineer primarily utilizing React and the React Ecosystem to build out various sections for BeachbodyonDemand.  I was involved in developing the BODi livestream platform as well as led the efforts implement Next.js to integrate with the Beachbody CMS and product pages which would lead to faster page loads and improved SEO ranking.

I switched to [EVgo](https://evgo.como) in 2022, immediately onboarding as a Sr Software Engineer II to help build out a microservice architecture for managing customer and business transactions for utilizing charging systems and equipment primarily written in GraphQL. I added features to improve backend response time and calculations for charging transactions, TOU as well as provide API for visualization of data for front-end dashboards, which I also maintained utilizing React and its ecosystem.

## Outside of Work

I have mentored for the last 10 years with companies like General Assembly, Thinkful as well as organizing meetups in Los Angeles and Orange County to learn software engineering via [Meetup.com](https://meetup.com/javascriptla).  I love to teach as it is always a joy to help others feel successful, plus I feel like I improve my own understanding of complicated topics in software engineering.
