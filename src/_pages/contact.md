## When Contacting Me

Short messages are usually the best, as I prefer that to writing lengthy emails back and forth. Please be sure to state your full name, company you represent and your business.  I will do my best to get back to you in a timely manner.

I am reside near Los Angeles, CA, however I prefer to work remote or hybrid and am willing to work for any company offering remote or hybrid roles in software engineering or web development.  

Open to contract roles, however contract roles are preferred remote.  Prefer roles that are 6 months to 1 year in length.
