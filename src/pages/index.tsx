          Hi, and welcome to my web developer portfolio. I decided to create a
          portfolio given that the traditional 'paper' resume feels a bit
          incomplete in this modern era. It feels a bit impossible to sum up
          EVERYTHING about me onto two pieces of paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realize some people just want the "cliff notes", and so yes I would
          hand them a resume, but for those who are more detail oriented like
          myself, I think they would appreciate a website like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          My specialty has been building websites using platforms like React,
          Node, Next.js, GraphQL, Drupal, Wordpress, and more. Along the way, I
          also started a group called{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.hackbuddy.com/"
            rel="noreferrer"
            target={"_blank"}
          >
            Hackbuddy
          </a>{" "}
          which helps developers like myself become better at software
          engineering. I have also mentored and taught at coding bootcamps like
          General Assembly and Thinkful â€” all which I can say has helped me
          really understand how to learn and study better, and help others as
          well get up to speed on changing technologies.
